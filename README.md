# Hack-a-thing 2: React Native ToDo app
## Charles Johnson & Michelle Yu

### What We Did

We built an app using React Native and Expo based on this [tutorial](https://pusher.com/tutorials/build-to-do-app-react-native-expo). This was a to-do list app where a user could add/remove tasks as well as mark them complete. Different components were created to do things such as inputting text or listing out existing tasks. We used features from AsyncStorage to keep track of the current tasks. Expo was used to provide structure including taking care of the build processes and providing several packages such as expo's vector icons.

### Who Did What

We both met initially to explore several options of what to create, Michelle went through the tutorial initially and set up the base of the app using Expo as well as adding features such as asycstorage, colors, input, headers and list components.
Charlie then created several additional features including adding fun images and alerts to verify that a task was created or allow the user to clear all tasks from the list and creating another alert congratulating the user after they had done so.

### What We Learned

Through creating this app we learned about various capabilities of Expo's platform. This made is really easy to get started quickly since it helped set up and build our app. It also made testing easier since we could view our application in real time on our phones through the Expo app (which uses a QR code to sync). We also learned a lot about react native structure including creating and using components, passing props around and styling the page. We also used CRUD operations to manage functionality for the the to-do list items.

### Hack-a-thing Inspirations

It's very possible that we will be building some sort of mobile application as part of our final cs98 project. This hack-a-thing showed us how useful React-Native and Expo can be in being able to quickly put together something functional and could both be tools that we use in the future.

### What didn't Work

Initially, we were hoping to do a tutorial using Alexa (which is why our team name is alexathing). However, it got complicated since we would need to use an AWS account and were worried about unknowingly accruing charges. We also didn't have an alexa to test on, so we switched gears to the React-Native app.

Another challenge was that since our hack-a-thing was based on a tutorial, it was tricky to work on it separately. We ended up both reading through the tutorial, including the parts that we didn't work on directly.
